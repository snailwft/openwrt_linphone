/**
 * @addtogroup x509_module X.509 module
 *
 * The X.509 module provides X.509 support which includes:
 * - X.509 certificate (CRT) reading (see \c x509parse_crt() and
 *   \c x509parse_crtfile()).
 * - X.509 certificate revocation list (CRL) reading (see \c x509parse_crl()
 *   and\c x509parse_crlfile()).
 * - X.509 (RSA and ECC) private key reading (see \c x509parse_key() and
 *   \c x509parse_keyfile()).
 * - X.509 certificate signature verification (see \c x509parse_verify())
 * - X.509 certificate writing and certificate request writing (see
 *   \c mbedtls_x509write_crt_der() and \c mbedtls_x509write_csr_der()).
 *
 * This module can be used to build a certificate authority (CA) chain and
 * verify its signature. It is also used to generate Certificate Signing
 * Requests and X509 certificates just as a CA would do.
